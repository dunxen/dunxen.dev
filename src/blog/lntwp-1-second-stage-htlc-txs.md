If you've been diving into the internals of the Lightning Network, it's probably already clear
that some parts of the specification are just stupidly hard to grasp, even by the third time you've
tried to cram them into your frontal lobe. In fact, by then it probably makes less sense than when
you first encountered the idea. I'm hoping to use this series, called **_The Weird Parts_** for lack of
more exciting nomenclature to at least try to distill what these gremlins are trying to do.
Look, I can't guarantee you'll find this more helpful than what's already out the, let alone amusing in
any way. However, I'm hoping that at least one person venturing within the aqueducts of the Lightning Network
would appreciate this take on the topic in some way or another.
