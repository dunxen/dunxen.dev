Hi, I'm Duncan, and I'm an unlicensed software developer. Naturally, when I stumbled upon trying to write a good state machine
implementation for interactive transaction construction in [Lightning Dev Kit](https://github.com/lightningdevkit) (LDK), I blamed
my lack of credentials. Also, I've been a casual Rust user since Rust was a totally different language back in 2014. I've been only
over the past two years or so actually diving deeper into "modern" Rust.
