# dunxen.dev

I am a Bitcoin and Lightning contributor mostly spending time around [LDK](https://lightningdevkit.org) and [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). Previously studied physics and maths at the University of Pretoria, had ~~a failed startup~~ prompt business studies exposure, and quit my day job at [Luno](https://luno.com) (April 2019 - February 2022). Mentor, mentee, and continuously learning.

### Umbani Wallet

I'm building [Umbani](https://umbani.app), a new cross-platform Bitcoin/LN wallet focusing on 🇿🇦 , which will make use of:
- [BDK](https://bitcoindevkit.org) for Bitcoin wallet features
- [LDK](https://lightningdevkit.org) for Lightning Network features
- [Nakamoto](https://github.com/cloudhead/nakamoto) as an SPV node
- [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/) for Tor
- ...maybe it will include [fedimint.org](https://fedimint.org) support too 👀
